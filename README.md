# 🚀 Golang Journey 2026: From Scrap PC to Backend Engineer

> **Current Status:** Day 1  
> **Location:** Hyderabad, India  
> **Focus:** Golang, Microservices, System Design  

## 📖 The Story: Why This Repo Exists
I am a self-taught Backend Engineer with a hunger for high-performance systems. 

I didn't start with a MacBook. I couldn't afford one. 
**I built my current rig from scrap parts**—an i3 4th Gen wired into a wall-mounted cardboard slot with a custom cooling solution. 

This repository documents my daily grind to master **Golang**, build production-grade software, and land a Backend Engineering role in a high-growth Hyderabad startup.

**No fluff. No paid courses. Just documentation, code, and shipping.**
